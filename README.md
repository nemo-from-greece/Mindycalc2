A calculator for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry) to facilitate the math when making basically anything. Currently under development, probably to remain that way until 2026 or beyond.

Similar tools can be found at https://zeeronis.github.io/Mindustry-Calc/ and https://mindustry-calc-a.onrender.com/. 

Almost all images are taken from Mindustry and/or the [Unofficial Wiki](https://mindustry-unofficial.fandom.com/wiki/Mindustry_Unofficial_Wiki), and I take no credit for them.

When new content gets added, Data will need to be updated, along with UI (lines 86, 89 and 104) to ensure things function as expected.
